# Project Overview
This data visualization project aims to provide an interactive and informative visualization of parks and their amenities within a given area. The project utilizes various technologies, including Python Flask for the API, HTML/CSS for the frontend, JavaScript for user interaction, and Leaflet for map visualization.

Our project offers three main views:

**Map View:** Displaying park locations on an interactive map.
