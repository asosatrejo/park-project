This data visualization project displays an interactive visualization of Mecklenburg County parks and their amenities within a given area. The project utilizes various technologies, including Python Flask for the API, HTML/CSS for the frontend, JavaScript for user interaction, and Leaflet for map visualization.

# Project highlights:
* **Backend** Our visualization includes a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB database. <br>
* **Frontend** Our Mecklenburg County Parks dashboard page includes multiple charts that all update from the same dataset. <br>
* **JS Library** The dashboard displays park zip codes using the charts.js library that updates when a specific city is selected. <br>
* **Dataset** It is powered by a dataset containing records for 365 parks. <br>
* **User-driven interaction** Our dashboard uses a drop down menu to filter parks by city with a zoom feature that centers the map.. Markers are also color coded to display parks with and without playgrounds. <br>
* **Views** The visualization includes a Leaflet map with a tile layer from OpenStreetMaps for location, a chart with park zip codes, a filtered list of park amenities, and an amenities gauge to show the average number of 
 amenities. <br>

### Usage
The map view displays markers representing parks on an interactive map.
Users can select a city from the dropdown menu to filter parks by city.
Clicking on a park marker on the map will display detailed information about the selected park.
The "Park Amenities View" lists the amenities available at the selected park.
