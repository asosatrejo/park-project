# Project Overview
This data visualization project displays an interactive visualization of Mecklenburg County parks and their amenities within a given area. The project utilizes various technologies, including Python Flask for the API, HTML/CSS for the frontend, JavaScript for user interaction, and Leaflet for map visualization.

Our project offers three main views:

**Map View:** Displaying park locations on an interactive map.<br>
**Park Information View:** Providing detailed information about a selected park.<br>

Users can select a city from the dropdown menu to filter parks by city.
Clicking on a park marker on the map will display detailed information about the selected park in the "Park Information View."
The "Park Amenities View" lists the amenities available at the selected park.
